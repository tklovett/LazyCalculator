LazyCalculator
==============

This is a calculator. It's lazy. It doesn't really like to do math. It judges you for trying to use it. Especially for the simple problems you would try to use it for.

## Get the code

`$ git clone https://github.com/tklovett/LazyCalculator.git`

## Install the app.

Attempt to install LazyCalculator.apk on your phone. It's Android though, so its not going to work on the first try. But go ahead and try if you want. Be my guest.

## Build the code

Open the project in Eclipse. Hopefully its that easy, but again its Android, so it probably won't.
